+ Dataloader accepts Custom Datasets
+ Dataset train/valid split and train/valid/test split
- Dataloader is faster (again); remove the performance regression
- Autolabel pipeline runs through the entire way
- Autolabel pipeline is robust to long occlusions without movement
- Autolabel pipeline is robust to hidden aruco marker in some frames
- Autolabel pipeline is now reusable for different datasets
- Dataset API supports data processing function before passing to the jax code (on the cpu maybe??)
- Premade data processing functions: Basic augmentations, DINOv2 embedding (on the cpu maybe??)
+ Fix invalidate files bug where it deletes the actual datasets!
