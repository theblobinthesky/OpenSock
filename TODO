+ Dataloader accepts Custom Datasets
+ Dataset train/valid split and train/valid/test split
- Dataloader is faster (again); remove the performance regression
+ Autolabel pipeline runs through the entire way
- Autolabel pipeline is robust to long occlusions without movement
+ Autolabel pipeline is robust to hidden aruco marker in some frames
+ Autolabel pipeline is now reusable for different datasets
+ Autolabel has new visualization with a display of tracks
+ Dataset supports data processing function before passing to the jax code (on the cpu maybe??)
- Premade data processing functions: Basic augmentations, DINOv2 embedding (on the cpu maybe??)
+ Fix invalidate files bug where it deletes the actual datasets!
- Refactor object detection code to use native dataloader
+ Autolabel detects and marks occluded frames automatically
- Autolabel pipeline stabilizer simultaneously optimizes for keeping the second marker quadratical
+ Autolabel pipeline video tracker merging: a inside b for mt. thresh frames -> remove a
+ Autolabel pipeline image tracker uses classification model and improves brightness+contrast of socks to make them more recognizable
- Autolabel pipeline detects frames using some heuristic that is more useful than what we currently use
- Enable training of classification model
- Enable 0-100 autolabeling: autolabel, train custom classificator, autolabel with custom classificator
- Autolabel stabilizer takes into account camera calibration
