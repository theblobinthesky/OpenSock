Hello codex. This is the specification for my Data Collection Web Interface for OpenSock.

# General goal of OpenSock
Users can take an image of a heap of socks, spread out on the ground. The app then tells them, which are pairs and who they belong to in the family.

# General goal of the website
Data collection of sock images for learning to differentiate them in training.
First, instruct the user as to what data they should collect.
Once they are educated, allow them to take pictures and upload them to our servers.

## What do i mean by instruct?
I need a guide made up of "slides". Each slide is mostly an instruction image, with maybe a bit of text.
Example:
- Slide 1: [Image of a pair of socks, with a circle around the left sock] 
    Collect 20-30 pairs of socks and take one of them out of each pair.
    All of these socks should be different in some way, e.g. a different color, size, pattern etc..
    You can purposely add socks with only subtle differences, just don't use identical socks.

- Slide 2: [Socks spread out flat on the floor; Every sock is stretched out] Take a photo like that. Don't move them between the photos.
- Slide 3: [Socks turned on the other side; Every sock is stretched out] Take a photo like that. -|-
- Slide 4: [Socks crumbled a bit, to disguise their size] Take a photo like that. -|-
- Slide 5: [Socks crumbled in a different way, to disguise their size] Take a photo like that. -|-
- Slide 6: Take as many different configs as you like.


## What do i mean by collect?
The user has the ability to take a new photo or upload existing ones.
The user has the ability to insert their name.

"If you want to appear in the credits of my project, if it works:"
The user has the ability to insert their Instagram, X, etc. handle in a different field in plain text.



# Technical details
The site should translate at least to German and English, but honestly should be extensible.
It's really important everything is translated, as even old people should be able to use it.
The site is supposed to be collecting images of socks (for )

# Tech Stack
Use React for the frontend and Go for the backend.
We should discuss, whether one even needs a database here. Maybe.
